## Training
* To train the models, **train.csv** needs to be in the same path with **109550130_Final_train.ipynb**.  
* After training, the model will be saved as **my_model**, which is for the test data.  
  
## Test
* In **109550130_Final_inference.ipynb**, similarly, **test.csv** needs to be in the same path with the code of inference.  
* After loading the model saved before(**my_model**), the result of prediction would be saved in **109550130_submission.csv**.
